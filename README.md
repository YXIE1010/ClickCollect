## ClickCollect
An interactive tool to collect data points from graph via mouse clicks
### An example: Ka-band Zenith Radar observations with melting layer
![alt text](https://github.com/YXIE1010/ClickCollect/blob/main/Figure/Figure_1.png)  
The figure shows the [Ka-band ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR)](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/instruments/kazr) observations at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site on 
May 18, 2015 from 18:00 to 24:00 UTC. The melting layer at around 1.8 km above the ground signifies the height where snow melts into rain, and generate distinctive
signatures in both radar reflectivity and doppler velocity observations.

### Interactive collection of melting layer boundaries via mouse clicks
- upper boundary of melting layer  
If melting layer exists, the code will then prompt you to click on the figures to collect information of melting layer boundaries. 
This tool also allows users to adjust previous clicks by dragging the data marker when it turns from a circle to a triangle, as shown in the figure below.

- lower boundary of melting layer  
After you are satisfied with your choice of upper boundary, go ahead and pick the lower boundary of the melting layer.

### Sanity check of the collected melting layer
The tool will then visualize the collected melting layer for users to double check, and to decide whether to save the data points or not.
